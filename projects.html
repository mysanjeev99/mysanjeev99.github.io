							<h2>Rebar Detection and Angle offset calculation of individual steel rods</h2>
							<p>Positioning and placement of steel rods in rebar plays vital role in strength and rigidity. Combined framework of deeplearning algorithm and computer vision, The model is trained to detect steel rebar and calculate the angle offset between each steel rod, which can be used in largescale machine based arrangement with accuracy and in short time.</p>

							<h2>Voice Activated Face Recognition Based Smart Support</h2>
							<p>Smart devices are technological advancements. This smart support system will be working alternative to a assistant and this is build toward organizations which required certain standards of security and privacy.</p>

							<h2>Detection of Rebar and spacing calculation</h2>
							<p>Steel rod arrangement in a rebar plays a vital role in strength and rigidity, Combined framework of deeplearning algorithm and computer vision, The model is trained to detect steel rods and calculate the gap between each steel rods in the rebar, which can be used in largescale machine based arrangement with accuracy and in short time.</p>

							<h2>Crack Detection using deeplearning techniques for assessment of structural integrity</h2>
							<p>Training Deeplearning model using FRCNN ResNet50 algorithm to detect cracks in concrete walls for evaluating structural integrity.</p>

							<h2>Classification of Corrosion in metal Pipes and structure</h2>
							<p>Deeplearing model is created to classification the corrosion in metal Pipes and structure on different corrosion levels -Extreme level, Moderate level and Low level.</p>

							<h2>Vehicle Crash Prediction System</h2>
							<p>Vehicle Crash Prediction System can predict a vehicle Crash using Deeplearning method that includes Tensorflow and OpenCV.</p>

							<h2>Posture detection using deeplearning</h2>
							<p>A Human Pose Skeleton represents the orientation of a person in a graphical format. Essentially, it is a set of coordinates that can be connected to describe the pose of the person.</p>

							<h2>UAV Flight Control using hand gesture</h2>
							<p>Implementing Deeplearning model and computer vision on inbuilt camera in UAV to recognize hand gesture and using this data to control the flight of the UAV.</p>

							<h2>Autonomous UAV using GPS and Telemetry Communications</h2>
							<p>Drone built on quad copter frame with telemetry radio for wireless communication, GPS and Compass for positioning and direction, various safety features and monitoring system. This drone is capable of autonomous flight by uploading mission data for the autonomous flight. </p>

							<h2>Smart Home Security System with 3-factor Authentication</h2>
							<p>Home security system using 3-factor authentication system using fingerprint, pin and OTP, With different level of user access with remote lock feature.</p>

							<h2>IOT based Vehicle tracking system</h2>
							<p>Tracking location of a vehicle using a GPS module and update the information in Realtime using google API and GSM module for network communication which can be deployed in an organization.   </p>
							
							<h2>Wireless Power Transfer using electromagnetic induction</h2>
							<p>Wireless Power Transfer using electromagnetic induction principle. When there is a continue flow of electricity in a circular coil and another circular coil placed parallel to the first coil there will be electricity induced into second coil from the first coil, Thus electricity is transmitted without any contact.</p>
							
							<h2>Long Range Audio transmission using LASER</h2>
							<p>LASER has unique properties and data transmission is one of its property. Audio source can be connected to a laser using an amplifier which will act as transmitter and a photo diode can be used as receiver and then connected to an amplifier for audio output.</p>
							
							<h2>Wireless Voice communication using RF Module</h2>
							<p>wireless voice communication device built using transmitter module and receiver module tuned at fixed radio frequency </p>
