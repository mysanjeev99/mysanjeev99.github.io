							<h2>Rebar Detection and Angle offset calculation of individual steel rods</h2>
							<p>Positioning and placement of steel rods in rebar plays a vital role in strength and rigidity. Using computer vision the model is trained to detect steel rebar and calculate the angle offset between each steel rod which can be used in largescale machine based arrangement with good accuracy and in a short span of time.</p>

							<h2>Voice Activated Face Recognition Based Smart Support</h2>
							<p>Smart devices are technological advancements. This smart support system is a working alternative to a personal assistant and is built towards organizations which require certain standards of security and privacy.</p>

							<h2>Detection of Rebar and spacing calculation</h2>
							<p>Steel rod arrangement in a rebar plays a vital role in strength and rigidity. Using computer vision the model is trained to detect steel rods and calculate the gap between each steel rod in the rebar which can be used in largescale machine based arrangement with good accuracy and in a short span of time.</p>

							<h2>Crack Detection using deeplearning techniques for assessment of structural integrity</h2>
							<p>Training Deeplearning model using FRCNN ResNet50 algorithm to detect cracks in concrete walls for evaluating structural integrity.</p>

							<h2>Classification of Corrosion in metal Pipes and structure</h2>
							<p>This Deeplearing model was created to classify the corrosion in metal Pipes and structures on different corrosion levels -Extreme level, Moderate level and Low level.</p>

							<h2>Vehicle Crash Prediction System</h2>
							<p>A vehicle Crash Prediction System that predicts and warns the driver before a vehicle Crash. It makes use of a Deeplearning method that includes Tensorflow and OpenCV.</p>

							<h2>Human Posture detection using deeplearning</h2>
							<p>A deeplearning model created to detect Human Pose in a Skeleton form that represents the orientation of a person. Which can be used in fitness training applications.</p>

							<h2>UAV Flight Control using hand gesture</h2>
							<p>Implementing Deeplearning model and computer vision on inbuilt camera in UAV to recognize hand gestures and using this data to control the flight of the UAV.</p>

							<h2>Autonomous UAV using GPS and Telemetry Communications</h2>
							<p>Drone built on quad copter frame with telemetry radio for wireless communication, GPS and Compass for positioning and direction, various safety features and monitoring system. This drone is capable of autonomous flight by uploading mission data. </p>

							<h2>Smart Home Security System with 3-factor Authentication</h2>
							<p>Home security system using 3-factor authentication system using fingerprint, pin and OTP. It comes with different user access levels and also a remote lock feature.</p>

							<h2>IOT based Vehicle tracking system</h2>
							<p>It tracks the location of a vehicle using a GPS module and updates the information in google cloud API and GSM module for network communication in realtime. This can be deployed in an organization.   </p>
							
							<h2>Wireless Power Transfer using electromagnetic induction</h2>
							<p>Wireless Power Transfer using electromagnetic induction principle. When there is a continuous flow of electricity in a circular coil and another circular coil placed parallel to the first coil there will be electricity induced into second coil from the first coil, thus electricity is transmitted without any contact.</p>
							
							<h2>Long Range Audio transmission using LASER</h2>
							<p>LASER has unique properties and data transmission is one of its property. Audio source can be connected to a laser using an amplifier which will act as transmitter and a photo diode can be used as receiver and then connected to an amplifier for audio output.</p>
							
							<h2>Wireless Voice communication using RF Module</h2>
							<p>wireless voice communication device built using transmitter module and receiver module tuned at a fixed radio frequency. </p>
