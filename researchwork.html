							<h2>Real-time assessment of surface cracks in concrete structures using integrated deep neural networks with autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle</h2>
							<p>Ensuring the structural integrity of civil infrastructures is critical, given the potential hazards presented by cracks. Traditional manual inspections, though common, often face challenges related to accuracy, accessibility, safety, and cost-effectiveness. To address these issues, this study presents a new approach that integrates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with advanced computer vision techniques. A key feature of our approach is a system where a self-operating UAV is paired with a carefully crafted deep-learning design. This design takes advantage of both the Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (FRCNN) and Residual Network (ResNet) models, allowing for real-time and accurate crack detection from ongoing video feeds. For uninterrupted real-time processing, our UAV is equipped with a data transmission module, sending live video to a computational platform enhanced with our advanced crack-spotting tool. After thorough training using a diverse dataset of 1000 images, our FRCNN-ResNet model was compared to other top models, achieving a precision rate of 93.3% and a quick 59.7ms inference time. Overall, this study offers a notable improvement in how we monitor civil structures, focusing on better safety and cost savings.</p>

							<h2>Voice Activated Face Recognition based Smart Support System</h2>
							<p>Voice assistants usually respond to voice commands and provide the user with specific details about his question. Currently, voice assistants can process product orders, answer questions, perform tasks such as playing music, or initiate a quick phone call with a friend. For voice assistants, the long-term goal is to serve as a smart bridge between humans and the immense information and capabilities delivered by the Internet. Taking away the need to use some gadget or screen to communicate in various locations with the internet, technology or other humans. This paper deals with such a voice assistance for schedule maintenance for individual which starts with the face recognition. Once a person enters the classroom / office, their face is captured and the face identification is done. If the identified person is the authorised one, then the system responds with a greeting message. When the person starts to ask about the schedule to the system, it responds with the schedule of the day of that identified person. In case of emergency schedules like meetings, the intimation is sent to the user as a message to alert him/her.</p>
